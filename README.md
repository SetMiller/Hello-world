# Hello-world
Let the study of web development begun

Hi Web-dev-beings!

I'm a little bit new here, so I just trying to understand how GIthub works and learn more about HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. 
I think it will be a long way from understanding what is happening here to writing my own web pages ;)
So feel free to connect this me, if you think it's necessary.

Best regards,
Set Miller.
